## Hi there 👋

I'm Arinzechukwu

I'm a **Junior Backend Developer** with hands-on experience designing and delivering **production-ready RESTful APIs** using **ASP.NET Core** and modern backend architecture patterns.

I focus on building systems that are **scalable, testable, secure, and maintainable**, applying best practices such as **Clean Architecture, CQRS/MediatR, and SOLID principles**. I approach engineering with ownership — asking *why*, anticipating failure paths, and designing solutions that hold up long-term.
